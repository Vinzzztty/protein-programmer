name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.

A country is big if:

1. it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
2. it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
